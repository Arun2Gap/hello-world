# hello-world
create to know how github work

mistakely not checked the "initailize this repository with a README".
-this will let you immediately clone the repository to your computer.skip this if you're import from existing repository.

Then, it redirect to another page(step).
There it is mentioned that we recommend every repository include a README,LICENSE, and gitignore.

After knowing that I go back to "check the README" but it shows the repository name altready exist.
Then,click on the README hyperLink it navigate me to the code edit page(here)
